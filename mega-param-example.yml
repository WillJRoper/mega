# LABEL: An example MEGA input file

inputs:

  data:                <filepath>     # The filepath containing particle data
  snapList:            <filepath>     # The filepath pointing to the snapshot list file
  haloSavePath:        <filepath>     # The filepath and basename for halo outputs
  graphSavePath:       <filepath>     # The filepath and basename for graph outputs

flags:

  # Flags for processes, NOTE: To enable a process all above processes must be enabled
  halo:                1              # Flag for creating halo catalog
  subs:                1              # Find substructure within halos
  graphdirect:         1              # Flag for getting graph direct progenitor and descendant data
  subgraphdirect:      1              # Flag for getting subhalo graph direct progenitor and descendant data
  graph:               1              # Flag for building complete graphs
  subgraph:            1              # Flag to include subhalos in complete graphs (UNUSED CURRENTLY)

  # Subhalos aren't currently included in trees
  treehalos:           0              # Flag for splitting halos in tree halo catalog
  treedirect:          0              # Flag for getting tree direct progenitor and descendant data
  tree:                0              # Flag for building complete trees

  # Flags for how to run MEGA (only enable 1)
  useserial:           1              # Run in serial
  usemultiprocessing:  0              # Use python parallelisation with multiprocessing
  usempi:              0              # Use mpi (UNUSED CURRENTLY)

  # Input type flags (only enable 1)
  hdf5Input:           1              # Flag for HDF5 inputs, if False binary format is assumed

parameters:

  batchsize:           2000000        # The number of particles that are tested in the KDTree at once
  ini_alpha_v:         10             # The initial velocity linking length coefficient for phase-space iteration
